##Meritocracies depend on rational evaluation.

Problem is, humans are *really bad* at that.

We all have unconscious biases -- we favor people resemble us economically, socially, culturally -- leading to a work culture dominated by straight white men.

##Traditional research on the topic involves word associations.

Called "Implicit-Association Tests", they involve sorting words into categories. This project attempts to do something different: test implicit bias using real world LinkedIn profiles.

##An A/B testing toolbench.

This website allows running experiments where users will rank profiles against each other, first as-is for control, then with key information removed: picture and name.

An analysis screen will highlight profiles that performed better without that information, sign of bias.
